My Robotics Nanodegree First Project
It's about a shipping storage facility ran by robots and it has a room for the humans 
controlling them with a bathroom for them and a simulated 4 pickup trucks 
awaiting the packages to be loaded up.
Only the model by name 'myrobot2' is my own creation and the other models are included from the Gazebo online library.
